Passionate software engineer and functional coder. I love creating systems that scale and delight users. 

I'm currently at ZF as a principal Scala engineer, where we bring the fleet-orchestration technology we developed at Bestmile to a large scale with multi-thousand vehicle fleets.

Previously I was employee #10 at Nexthink where I made important contributions to its revolutionary software for user-centric enterprise IT, which has now grown to a billion-dollar worth business. 

Before Nexthink, I had created an application for computer-aided surgery which was used at several hospitals, for which I earned my Ph.D. at the University of Bern in 2006. I am also an EPFL graduate, where I earned my M.Sc. in 2001.

I've also done some teaching at the HEIG-VD engineering school and I sometimes speak at conferences and meetups.
